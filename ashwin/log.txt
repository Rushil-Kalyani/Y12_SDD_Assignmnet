* initialized github repository
* created base structure for launcher
* still unsure about the structure of my game.

Feb 10
* I decided to have a main script which calls different screen scripts. All of the game logic will be in the main script, while the gui/visuals are taken care of by the screen programs.
finished up a basic starting screen

Feb 11
* fixed an issue where button would sometimes not click
added player class which contains the logic of the snakes and ladders.

Feb 12
* added a color choose screen, where the player would select the color of their pawn.
* I might put the code for the pawn in the player class, since it doesnt really serve many other purposes.

Feb 13
* created an animate function, which takes two list of values and increments/decrements the values until the lists match at a given speed. Probably the most useful thing i made
* finished alpha version of the game. now starting work on scrolling bg

* scrolling background looks ugly. might do parallax instead.

Feb 15
* Scrapping scrolling background because of bugs & doesnt look that good.
