initialized github repository
created base structure for launcher
still unsure about the structure of my game.

I decided to have a main script which calls different screen scripts. All of the game logic will be in the main script, while the gui/visuals are taken care of by the screen programs.
finished up a basic starting screen

fixed an issue where button would sometimes not click
added player class which contains the logic of the snakes and ladders.

added a color choose screen, where the player would select the color of their pawn.
I might put the code for the pawn in the player class, since it doesnt really serve many other purposes.
