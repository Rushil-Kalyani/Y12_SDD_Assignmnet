* initialized github repository
* created base structure for launcher
* still unsure about the structure of my game.

Feb 10
* I decided to have a main script which calls different screen scripts. All of the game logic will be in the main script, while the gui/visuals are taken care of by the screen programs.
finished up a basic starting screen

Feb 11
* fixed an issue where button would sometimes not click
added player class which contains the logic of the snakes and ladders.

Feb 12
* added a color choose screen, where the player would select the color of their pawn.
* I might put the code for the pawn in the player class, since it doesnt really serve many other purposes.

Feb 13
* created an animate function, which takes two list of values and increments/decrements the values until the lists match at a given speed. Probably the most useful thing i made
* finished alpha version of the game. now starting work on scrolling bg

* scrolling background looks ugly. might do parallax instead.

Feb 15
* Scrapping scrolling background because of bugs & doesnt look that good.

Feb 16
* Added parallax effect bg for first two screens
* last screen has scrolling bg that looks better
* made a custom board. unsure about looks


Feb 17
* made a proper win exit condition, I have a good idea about an end animation

Feb 19
* finished ending animation
* if two dots are on the same sqaure, they separate

Feb 21
* starting work on multiplayer

Feb 23
* multiplayer mostly functional. need to add error checks on details screen

Feb 24
* multiplayer fully finished
* the dots move slightly if on the same square

Feb 27
* started working on a mine feature. When a player rolls a 6, they receive a mine which they can place on any square on the board. if a player steps on that square they go back to the beginning

Mar 2
* Sagar finished the main structure of the launcher. Took today to analyse the program

Mar 3
* finished the scrolling bg in the launcher (reused same bg from the game.)
* objects in scrolling bg now move at different speeds

Mar 4
* Mines are now fully working
